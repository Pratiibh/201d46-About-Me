    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h3>I attended Electrical Engineering courses for two and a half years at the following colleges:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Highline College</li>
    <li>University of Washington Seattle</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>I have had the following (unofficial) jobs before:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Calculus Tutor</li>
    <li>Lumberjack</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My top ten favorite things to do in a game of basketball are:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Shoot a clean three-pointer in a defender's face</li>
    <li>Euro-step between two defenders, with the last step giving enough air to reach a lay-up on the basket</li>
    <li>Swat a defenders' three-point shot right in front of them</li>
    <li>Cross a defender while driving the ball to the basket, finish with a contested lay-up</li>
    <li>Swat a defenders' layup from the side or behind while they are driving to the basket and release the ball for a layup or shot</li>
    <li>Fake a defender out by pivoting on one foot to sell the fake shot, spin back around and pivot on other foot, finish with a drive and lay-up straight to the basket</li>
    <li>Drive to the basket, slow down near the free-throw line, and go for a jumper on the basket while a defender gets faked out by the drive</li>
    <li>If basket is heavily contended, drive with the ball to the right-side of the court, and while running, jump up in the air and use both hands to throw ball with more force than usual towards the basket, to combat the momentum of moving to the side</li>
    <li>Have shoelaces get untied while very tired, so that the whole game can be paused and I can recover my breath while retying my shoe</li>
    <li>Usually play like trash because the above things very rarely happen</li>
    </ol>
